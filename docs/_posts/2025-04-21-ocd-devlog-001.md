## Future Codebase Design

Need to implement format preserving cluster definition parser. I will need to
use the `toml_edit` crate to do this. Right now for the initial setup of the
project I am following the advice of [Rain's Rust CLI Recommendations][rain-rcr]
for the initial design of the project's codebase.

I will be putting all core logic inside the `src/lib.rs` file such that only the
CLI and error handling code will be exposed to `main`. The `model` module will
contain the logic for cluster definition parsing.

## Cluster Definition Format

The following represents the basic layout for the cluster definition, i.e., the
file that resides in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ocd/cluster.toml`:

```
dir_alias = "$HOME/some/path"               # Optional field
excluded = ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3", ...] # Optional field

[nodes.node1]
deployment = "normal"                        # Mandatory field
url = "https://some/url"                     # Mandatory field
excluded = ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3", ...]  # Optional field
dependencies = ["dep1", "dep2", "dep3", ...] # Optional field

[nodes.node2]
deployment = { kind = "bare_alias", dir_alias = "$HOME/some/path" }
url = "https://some/url"

[nodes.node_n]
deployment = "bare_alias"
```

If cluster definition does not define `dir_alias` field for root table, then it
will default to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ocd` as its path. If a given node simply uses
`deployment = "bare_alias"` then the directory alias will be set to `$HOME` as
the default.

Format preservation in this case refers to the preservation of whitespace and
comments for any addition or removal of node entries in the cluster definition.
For now, replacement of existing node entries do not need to preserve
formatting.
