## Release Version 0.6.1

Published first release of OCD to [Crates.io][ocd-crate]. It is still unstable.
However, I hope people see the potential of the project! I even made an
announcment for this release on the [Rust language formum][ocd-announcment].

Future versions will now focus on stablization. I need to improve logging
output, and add more tests to catch bugs that I know still exist.
